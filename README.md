# drone
Custom 3D-printed drone project, initially designed and tested in 2023 

## Project Description
- Small fixed-wing V-tail aircraft
- Controlled using a flight controller, BLDC motor for propulsion, and servo motors for wing and tail flaps
- All designs made in OnShape and 3D printed out of PLA using a BambuLab X1C!

## CAD Models
All CAD models of the design iterations are linked below:

## Improvements
- Version 1 was too nose-heavy, so I shifted the center of mass further towards the rear of the drone in the next iteration. This includes shifting the battery back and reducing the infill density to lower the weight near the front
- The wings did not generate enough lift for maintained flight. The next iteration of the design uses wings with a larger surface area and sharper angle of attack. Moreover, when the wings from the initial design were 3D-printed, they were not completely smooth, likely causing further issues with lift. To resolve this, the wings have been reoriented in printing.
- Versions 1 and 2 were too heavy overall, so the size of the body was reduced and parts were designed and manufactured to be thinner and more lightweight.
